This is the *Zookeeper with Java* project I made myself from scratch.


<br>

Solution:
<p>A tool to help the local zoo take care of its animals by keeping an eye on them.</p>

<br>

Tech Stack:
- Java

<br>

Stages:
1. Process commands from the zookeepers and display the animals on a monitor
2. develop an animal printer and print an image of an animal
3. Recognize the number of a specific habitat from the input and show the animals living there
4. Understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously without having to be restarted
